# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning solution to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines using sonar data. Utilizing Python and libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn, it includes data preprocessing, model training with logistic regression, and performance evaluation. The model achieves a test accuracy of 76%, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in sonar data analysis.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing using Kaggle APIs
- Statistical analysis of sonar data
- Model training with logistic regression
- Evaluation of model performance with accuracy metrics
- Implementation of a predictive system for real-time classification

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of sonar signals reflected off rocks and mines. It is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+%28Sonar%2C+Mines+vs.+Rocks%29).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilal-khan-1604/ML_1_Sonar_Prediction.git
   cd ML_1_Sonar_Prediction
   ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
